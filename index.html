            I am a web developer with 2 years of experience.

            I have been teaching mathematics for 10 years at high school in ISTANBUL. With this web developing journey, I would like to work in this field too.

          Mert is a great member of our team. Working with him is a very nice experience for me.
          I have been working with him for 3 years and we managed really nice projects together.
          I definitely would like to work with him on new projects.

          I had worked with Mert during a web development project for a local company.
          He was committed and added a lot of value while we were creating the web page.
          It was one of the best pojects in which his talents were revealed.

        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          When I was working at IBM, Mert was a member of the company who had great communication skills
          He was not only good at programming but also good at teamwork and creativity. I absolutely 
          want to continue to work with him in my future projects.
